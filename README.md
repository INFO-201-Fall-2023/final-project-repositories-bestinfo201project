This data includes tax records, social security payments, unemployment benefits, and other forms of government assistance.

- **Industry data:** Data from various industries and sectors, such as retail sales, services, and manufacturing, are used to estimate consumer spending and income from different sources.
- **Interpretation and Estimation:** The BEA can extrapolate from these previous techniques using a variety of methods to create a more wholistic picture of consumer spending and the overall economic state.  

This data has 180 observations, however, each of these observations is tripled so there are only 60 unique observations with 308 variables.
